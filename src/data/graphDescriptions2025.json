    "question": "Do you incorporate digital sustainability considerations in your role-specific tasks? (By Organizational Context)",
    "description": "This chart illustrates the relationship between the organizational context and whether employees incorporate sustainability into their work. Respondents are categorized by their organization's stance: 'No sustainability' (organization does not incorporate practices), 'Unclear communication' (respondent is unsure), or by the number of specific measures in place (1 to 4+). Generally, as organizations adopt more measures (goals, teams, practices, coordination, reporting, training), employees are more likely to incorporate sustainability. An exception is observed at three measures, where a specific combination often lacks training/resources, highlighting the importance of employee support."
